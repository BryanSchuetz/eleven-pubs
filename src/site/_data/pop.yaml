    title: 'Partnerships matter for growth.'
    description: |
      There’s an old African proverb that says if you want to fast, go alone, but if you want to go far, go together. In other words, people and relationships lie at the heart of success. At DAI, we depend on our partners. Not just our co-implementers and small businesses, but crucially our local partners in the countries where we work. Development is inherently local and collaborative – local leadership and participation are essential.

      In the face of development challenges that are evolving all the time, local partners offer firsthand knowledge and an enduring commitment to the places where they live. Local people know that their children will grow up in the schools they build and look for employment in the firms whose growth they support. They have a natural interest in achieving durable results. Our experience shows that in the economic growth arena and beyond, effective local partnerships are key to innovation, scale, and sustainability.

    title: 'How Vietnam is leveraging partnerships in pursuit of net zero.'
    description: |
      Following two decades of rapid growth, Vietnam is now the world’s 19th largest greenhouse gas emitter. How can the country pursue its growth goals and still reach net zero? 
    fulldesc: |
      By any measure, Vietnam is a huge success story. In the space of just 20 years, from 2000 to 2020, the country’s GDP grew from US$31 billion to $346 billion. But alongside these substantial achievements, carbon emissions have grown sevenfold since 2000, making Vietnam the world’s 19th largest carbon emitter. The government has pledged the country would reach net zero by 2050, but Vietnam faces increasing challenges around reducing fossil fuel-based energy, transportation, and industrial processing. In May 2023, the government approved the Power Development Plan 8, which lays out how it will reach its green energy goals. Wind and solar power, which Vietnam hopes will account for 60 percent of its energy generation by 2050, are crucial parts of the plan, but to put that plan into place the government will need to attract billions in investment. So it’s charting a path to change its future, through partnership.
