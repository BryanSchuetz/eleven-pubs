<p>In 2016, Colombia turned a historic page by signing the Peace Accords, bringing an end to more than five decades of conflict with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). But a lasting peace requires more than the absence of war—it requires rebuilding trust, strengthening communities, and ensuring good governance from the ground up.&nbsp;</p><p>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/colombia-responsive-governance-rg-activity?ref=pubs.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">Responsive Governance Activity (RG)</a> promotes effective governance and supports the Peace Accords in 34 conflict-affected municipalities. RG helps bridge the gap between Colombian citizens and the state by enhancing accountability and encouraging citizen participation.&nbsp;</p><p>A cornerstone of RG's approach is the recognition that effective governance requires the engagement of all elements of Colombian society. Colombia is a tapestry of communities, each with its own needs and perspectives. Approximately 3.1 million of Colombia’s 52 million citizens are people with disabilities, for example, and 1.9 million are Indigenous. These and other groups will play a critical role in shaping the future of their municipalities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Led by Chief of Party <a href="https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/carla-aguilar?ref=pubs.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">Carla Aguilar</a>, RG has ensured that gender and social inclusion principles are reflected in every aspect of its work, from the selection of activities to project recruitment and talent management. At one point in the project, for example, women accounted for 60 percent of staff, and youth 33 percent. Most important, by ensuring a strong internal understanding of and commitment to inclusion, RG is engaging a fuller representation of Colombians in its programming, as the following diagram makes clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/assets/images/2025/01/data-src-image-32ce4953-da5c-4124-8f91-d23d1d6a5b15.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="A graph with numbers and text

One of them is the implementation of the Special Rural Education Plan for the Awá community in Pacific Nariño—a new teaching model that respects Awá traditions and needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>RG trained teachers to manage mixed-grade classrooms, adapt their grading practices accordingly, and incorporate Awá culture into lessons. Working across 32 schools, the project worked with 138 teachers—about half of all Awá educators in the region—and established a network of lead teachers to collaborate and share best practices. These initiatives will benefit 5,712 Awá students, providing them with meaningful learning experiences more closely attuned to Awá needs and aspirations.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="building-peace-through-civic-engagement"><strong>Building Peace through Civic Engagement</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Sustainable governance requires active civic participation. Across Colombia, RG has supported hundreds of underserved communities and civil society organizations in strengthening their civic involvement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/assets/images/2025/01/RG-Colombia_Figure-3.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1289" srcset="/assets/images/size/w600/2025/01/RG-Colombia_Figure-3.jpg 600w, /assets/images/size/w1000/2025/01/RG-Colombia_Figure-3.jpg 1000w, /assets/images/size/w1600/2025/01/RG-Colombia_Figure-3.jpg 1600w, /assets/images/2025/01/RG-Colombia_Figure-3.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="innovating-at-a-national-level"><strong>Innovating at a National Level</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>RG's initiatives at the municipal level have positioned the project to inform national policies. Since March 2022, RG has provided technical support to the Vice Presidency in developing, monitoring, and evaluating public policies, including implementation of the ethnic chapter of the Peace Agreement and efforts to support people with disabilities. Colombia ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2009. In collaboration with the Vice Presidency and National Planning, RG co-designed a methodology to amplify the voices of local communities in disability policy, enabling them to shape a constructive approach centered on the autonomy and independence of disabled people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As part of its support, RG organized a Call for Experts to foster dialogue with professionals in the field, bringing together stakeholders from academia, think tanks, and territorial authorities to evaluate results, share good practices, and analyze lessons learned from disability policies in Colombia and comparable countries. The goal is to create a critical and constructive space for collaboration.&nbsp;</p><p>As RG enters its fifth year, our broader goal is to ensure that this forum—like the other initiatives we have supported—is positioned to sustain its contribution to inclusive governance in Colombia.&nbsp;</p>
