<p>This year is on course to be the world’s warmest on record. With regions like the Sahel experiencing unprecedented heatwaves, temperatures in many African countries have reached nearly 40℃. While these conditions underscore the urgency of addressing climate change, they also highlight an opportunity for promoting growth and resilience.&nbsp;</p><p>Introducing&nbsp;climate finance—investments aimed at mitigating and adapting to climate change—can be a game changer for African countries seeking to tackle the climate crisis. By channeling funds into sustainable initiatives, governments and citizens alike can address climate-related issues and build more resilient communities, create sustainable livelihoods, and generate profit for African businesses. Climate finance also fosters collaboration between U.S. and other service providers and African businesses looking to leverage the latest climate technology to enhance climate resilience.</p><p>That is where the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/africa-trade-and-investment-ati-activity?ref=pubs.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">Africa Trade and Investment Activity (ATI)</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prosperafrica.gov/?ref=pubs.ghost.io">Prosper&nbsp;Africa</a> come in. These programs offer custom climate change solutions to help African governments, businesses, and smallholder farmers transition to more sustainable, productive, and profitable approaches amid a complex trade and investment landscape.&nbsp;</p><p>USAID and Prosper Africa—a presidential-level national security initiative to increase two-way trade and investment between the United States and Africa—collaborate through ATI to advance climate-focused initiatives through fund partners. Smallholder Agroforestry Finance, for example, will leverage $110 million with $3.2 million in catalytic capital from USAID for its carbon finance facility. ThirdWay Partners will leverage $70 million for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.acct.fund/?ref=pubs.ghost.io">Africa Conservation and Communities Tourism&nbsp;Fund</a>. In total, Prosper Africa and USAID expect to raise at least $700 million for climate finance solutions.</p><p>In addition to raising funds for climate innovation, the Prosper Africa-USAID partnership seeks to identify new opportunities for private partners in green initiatives.&nbsp;Liberia&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sierra Leone, for example,&nbsp;are home to&nbsp;the Gola National Forest, one of the largest and most biologically diverse rainforests in West Africa. USAID ATI recently launched feasibility studies that map out climate financing opportunities to boost private sector investment for cross-border&nbsp;conservation&nbsp;efforts that would benefit Gola. The project also published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.climatelinks.org/resources/climate-finance-low-emissions-agriculture-sub-saharan-africa-climate-finance-innovation?ref=pubs.ghost.io">Climate Finance for Low-Emission Agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa</a>&nbsp;and developed a corresponding&nbsp;<a href="https://www.climatelinks.org/climate-finance-low-emissions-agriculture-sub-saharan-africa-toolbox?ref=pubs.ghost.io#:~:text=The%20Climate%20Finance%20For%20Low,their%20respective%20countries%20in%20SSA.">toolbox</a>&nbsp;that provides guidance and recommendations outlining how USAID’s agriculture, food security, and resilience programs can better promote the flow of sustainable and inclusive climate finance in Sub-Saharan Africa.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="clean-energy-a-trade-and-investment-opportunity"><strong>Clean Energy: A Trade and Investment Opportunity</strong></h2><p>Inadequate access to reliable electricity remains a critical constraint to the social and economic growth prospects of 580 million people in Africa. To meet the needs of a population currently lacking access to&nbsp;energy&nbsp;while capitalizing on an enormous opportunity for private sector investment and innovation in the electricity sector, Prosper Africa and USAID, through ATI, are helping boost exports of U.S. clean technologies to Africa through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usaid.gov/powerafrica/CTEN?ref=pubs.ghost.io">U.S.-Africa Clean Tech Energy Network&nbsp;(CTEN</a>).</p><p>The cross-border CTEN network—led by a partnership between Prosper Africa-USAID and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usaid.gov/powerafrica?ref=pubs.ghost.io">Power&nbsp;Africa</a>&nbsp;initiative—has connected more than 100 firms with tailored clean tech opportunities in African markets. As the network expands, opening new market opportunities for U.S. and African businesses while improving access to reliable electricity, CTEN will increase U.S. clean energy exports to Africa and close at least $350 million worth of cleantech energy deals by 2026.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/assets/images/2024/12/Power-Africa-s-Clean-Tech-Energy-Network--CTEN--representatives-attended-the-U.S.-Africa-Business-Summit-2024.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="/assets/images/size/w600/2024/12/Power-Africa-s-Clean-Tech-Energy-Network--CTEN--representatives-attended-the-U.S.-Africa-Business-Summit-2024.jpg 600w, /assets/images/size/w1000/2024/12/Power-Africa-s-Clean-Tech-Energy-Network--CTEN--representatives-attended-the-U.S.-Africa-Business-Summit-2024.jpg 1000w, /assets/images/size/w1600/2024/12/Power-Africa-s-Clean-Tech-Energy-Network--CTEN--representatives-attended-the-U.S.-Africa-Business-Summit-2024.jpg 1600w, /assets/images/size/w2400/2024/12/Power-Africa-s-Clean-Tech-Energy-Network--CTEN--representatives-attended-the-U.S.-Africa-Business-Summit-2024.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Power Africa’s Clean Tech Energy Network (CTEN) representatives attended the U.S.-Africa Business Summit 2024 to explore U.S. clean energy exports to Africa.

As we head into 2025, climate finance will continue to hold immense potential to mitigate the risks posed by climate change and create new opportunities for trade and investment in sustainable industries, ultimately paving the way for inclusive, sustainable growth in Africa.</p><p><em>A version of this blog was first published on</em><a href="https://www.climatelinks.org/blog/mobilizing-climate-finance-strengthen-trade-and-investment-african-continent?ref=pubs.ghost.io"><em> ClimateLinks</em></a><em>.</em></p><div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-grey"><div class="kg-callout-text"><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Kyla Grau is a Senior Activity Specialist for the USAID ATI.
