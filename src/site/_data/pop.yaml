    title: Partnerships matter for growth. 
    description: |
      There’s an old African proverb that says if you want to fast, go alone, but if you want to go far, go together. In other words, people and relationships lie at the heart of success. At DAI, we depend on our partners. Not just our co-implementers and small businesses, but crucially our local partners in the countries where we work. Development is inherently local and collaborative – local leadership and participation are essential.

      There’s an old African proverb that says if you want to fast, go alone, but if you want to go far, go together. In other words, people and relationships lie at the heart of success.

      In the face of development challenges that are evolving all the time, local partners offer firsthand knowledge and an enduring commitment to the places where they live. Local people know that their children will grow up in the schools they build and look for employment in the firms whose growth they support. They have a natural interest in achieving durable results. Our experience shows that in the economic growth arena and beyond, effective local partnerships are key to innovation, scale, and sustainability.
