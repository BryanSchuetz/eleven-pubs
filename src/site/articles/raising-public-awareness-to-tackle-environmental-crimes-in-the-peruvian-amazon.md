<p>The Amazon River originates in the mountains of southern Peru and its rainforests cover more than 60 percent of the country’s territory. Yet Peru is most frequently associated with the Andes and its ancient cultures or with cities such as Lima on its dry coast. The enormous contributions of the Amazon to the country’s culture, wealth, development, and well-being typically don’t feature prominently in most Peruvians’ understanding of the region.</p><p>Indeed, studies carried out by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/peru-prevent?ref=pubs.ghost.io">Prevent project</a> in 2020 revealed that one of the most dangerous threats to the Peruvian Amazon was the lack of awareness of its problems. Surveys showed illegal logging, mining, and wildlife trafficking weren’t seen as priorities or even thought of as crimes by most Peruvians.</p><p>Prevent set out to elevate the conservation of the Amazon on the public agenda and garner public support for its protection, knowing that without these efforts, any strategy to tackle environmental crimes would fall short.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/assets/images/2024/10/AA5A4417b.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="/assets/images/size/w600/2024/10/AA5A4417b.jpg 600w, /assets/images/size/w1000/2024/10/AA5A4417b.jpg 1000w, /assets/images/size/w1600/2024/10/AA5A4417b.jpg 1600w, /assets/images/size/w2400/2024/10/AA5A4417b.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Amazonian artists like rapper El Ninio have been key to engaging new young audiences.

So the project’s first step was to share knowledge and try to spark a more informed debate. To achieve this, Prevent engaged some 450 journalists and communications professionals through online, in-person, and hybrid courses.</p><p>The project also launched the country’s first investigative journalism contest on environmental crimes in the Amazon. Journalists submitted innovative project proposals to investigate environmental crimes, yielding more than a dozen in-depth reports in leading outlets such as <em>El Comercio</em> and <em>Mongabay</em>, covering issues from jaguar trafficking to the impact of illegal logging on Indigenous communities.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/assets/images/2024/10/Foto_USAID_Ucayali095.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="/assets/images/size/w600/2024/10/Foto_USAID_Ucayali095.jpg 600w, /assets/images/size/w1000/2024/10/Foto_USAID_Ucayali095.jpg 1000w, /assets/images/size/w1600/2024/10/Foto_USAID_Ucayali095.jpg 1600w, /assets/images/size/w2400/2024/10/Foto_USAID_Ucayali095.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Training programs, journalism contests, and active dissemination of new evidence led to thousands of news articles.

The first online platform dedicated to environmental crimes in the Peruvian Amazon, the hub houses more than 150 original knowledge products—including studies, videos, podcasts, and infographics—and has become one of Peru’s most consulted online sources on environmental crimes, attracting more than 230,000 visitors and referenced by respected information platforms and media outlets.</p><p>Between 2019 and 2024, this integrated strategy yielded over 2,400 news stories and reports in local and national outlets. As journalist Ivan Brehaut, winner of the second edition of Prevent’s journalism contest, said: </p><blockquote>“The biggest need right now besides planting trees in the forest is planting trees in people’s minds. People need to be informed and know what we are facing.”</blockquote><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/assets/images/2024/10/CI9A4195.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="/assets/images/size/w600/2024/10/CI9A4195.jpg 600w, /assets/images/size/w1000/2024/10/CI9A4195.jpg 1000w, /assets/images/size/w1600/2024/10/CI9A4195.jpg 1600w, /assets/images/size/w2400/2024/10/CI9A4195.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Popular artists and musicians helped build a strong following for the Consecuencias campaign.

In response, Prevent launched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bing.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bing.com&source_ve_path=MTM5MTE3LDI4NjY0LDE2NDUwMw&v=LtNc7xzSJvU&feature=youtu.be&ref=pubs.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer"><em>Consecuencias</em></a> (Consequences) campaign in 2021, inviting the pop band Orquesta Explosión de Iquitos to create the first cumbia song—a style of music popular in Peru—dedicated to the conservation of the Amazon<em>.</em></p><p>Within days, a video of the song drew 800,000 views on social media. Shortly after, rapper El Ninio from Pucallpa, a city in Ucayali, joined the cause, creating a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/consecuencias.pe/videos/344321983696599">hip-hop song</a> about the effects of environmental crimes and generating a new wave of attention on social media. “I try to make sure every song has a reason, an experience, a reflection. I can't consider myself an artist if I'm not socially responsible,” says Pedro Pablo Salas, a.k.a. El Ninio. “It’s incredible seeing how far we’ve come.” &nbsp;</p><p>Dozens of other local and national young artists joined in as ambassadors, and leading companies such as LATAM Airlines, Electroriente, and ElectroUcayali extended the campaign’s reach. The intense media focus, a profusion of fun content on social media, and the endorsement of Amazonian music legends—all coming together through music festivals in Loreto, Ucayali, Madre de Dios, and Lima—consolidated <em>Consecuencias</em> as a collaborative model for raising conservation awareness among young people.</p><p>Rossy War, one of the most popular singers in the Amazon and an ambassador for <em>Consecuencias</em>, underscored the urgency of the effort: “We need to join efforts through social media and talk about this with our friends to help prevent environmental crimes.”</p><p>After its third year, the <em>Consecuencias</em> campaign surpassed 700 media appearances, more than 100 renowned artists and opinion leaders stepped up as ambassadors, and 70 leading companies and other allies contributed more than $1 million to prevent environmental crimes. More importantly, <em>Consecuencias</em> achieved its goal of elevating Amazon conservation in the minds of Peruvians, and especially the younger generation of Peruvians who will define their country’s future (campaign studies indicate it reached “recall levels” of around 80 percent and a “positive valuation” of more than 90 percent).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG-7.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1760" srcset="/assets/images/size/w600/2024/10/IMG-7.jpg 600w, /assets/images/size/w1000/2024/10/IMG-7.jpg 1000w, /assets/images/size/w1600/2024/10/IMG-7.jpg 1600w, /assets/images/size/w2400/2024/10/IMG-7.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Information-rich entertainments, fairs, concerts, and festivals helped young people to learn about and support Amazon conservation.

A once remote part of Peru is now closer to the everyday lives of Peruvian citizens, and we hope that this awareness will mean a more sustainable future for the Peruvian Amazon.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Key Prevent Results</strong></p><ul><li>450+ trained journalists and communication professionals.</li><li>2,400+ news stories and reports on environmental crimes.</li><li>≈ $1m in promotional actions to prevent environmental crimes with the private sector.</li></ul><p><em><strong>About USAID Prevent.</strong> From 2019 to 2024, Prevent worked with the government, civil society, the private sector, and citizens to prevent and combat environmental crimes (illegal logging, mining, and wildlife trafficking) to conserve the Peruvian Amazon and ensure the well-being of its inhabitants.
