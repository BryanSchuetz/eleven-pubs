<p>Amidst the excitement of the 2024 Paris Olympics, there's a team that often goes unnoticed—the <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/team-of-refugee-olympic-athletes-roa-created-by-the-ioc?ref=pubs.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>Refugee Olympic Team</u></a>. Having made its debut at the 2016 Olympics in response to global displacement challenges, this team's presence is particularly poignant now given Europe's <a href="https://www.rescue.org/article/ukraine-europes-largest-displacement-crisis-decades?ref=pubs.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>largest internal refugee</u></a> crisis since World War II, sparked by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The invasion has forced about <a href="https://reporting.unhcr.org/operational/operations/ukraine?ref=pubs.ghost.io#:~:text=Approximately%20one%2Dthird%20of%20Ukrainians,are%20displaced%20as%20refugees%20abroad." rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>one-third</u></a> of Ukrainians from their homes, with roughly 3.7 million people displaced internally and an additional 5 million seeking refuge abroad. &nbsp;</p><p>Global displacement has surged in recent decades, with an estimated <a href="https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu/what/humanitarian-aid/forced-displacement_en?ref=pubs.ghost.io#:~:text=As%20of%20May%202024%2C%20the,global%20figures%20for%20forced%20displacement." rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>120 million</u></a> forcibly displaced individuals worldwide, according to the European Union and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (<a href="https://www.unrefugees.org/refugee-facts/statistics/?ref=pubs.ghost.io#:~:text=Global%20Trends%20At%2Da%2DGlance,63.3%20million%20internally%20displaced%20people" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>UNHCR</u></a>). This global humanitarian emergency disrupts lives, strains host-community resources, and worsens socio-economic conditions, causing psychological trauma, lost livelihoods, and barriers to crucial services such as healthcare and education, particularly affecting women and children. Several DAI programs have been working on the refugee issue in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="putting-food-on-the-table-from-luhansk-to-lviv"><strong>Putting Food on the Table, From Luhansk to Lviv</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>Entrepreneur Yevhen Molchanov lost his bakery business in Stanytsia, Luhanska. With grant assistance from the <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/ukraine-economic-resilience-activity?ref=pubs.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>Economic Resilience Activity</u></a> (ERA), funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Molchanov has successfully revitalized his business in Lviv under the new name <a href="https://era-ukraine.org.ua/pidpryiemets-z-luhanshchyny-vypikaie-shaleni-pliushki-u-lvovi/?ref=pubs.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>Shalena Plushka</u></a>, which means “Crazy Pastry” in Ukrainian.&nbsp;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/assets/images/2024/08/Shalena-Plushka.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="960" height="821" srcset="/assets/images/size/w600/2024/08/Shalena-Plushka.jpg 600w, /assets/images/2024/08/Shalena-Plushka.jpg 960w"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Entrepreneur Yevhen Molchanov in his new bakery in Lviv.

Supported by the grant, he obtained essential bakery and trade equipment—rotary ovens, refrigeration units, dough processors, packaging tools, and a diesel generator—to restart after fleeing his hometown. "Nothing is impossible in life, and if there is a great desire, then opportunities will find you, even if you go through hell, you must not stop and keep going,” he said.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="making-temporary-shelters-welcoming-homes"><strong>Making Temporary Shelters Welcoming Homes</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>Yulia Stepanenko and her family abruptly began their journey in February 2022. Living in Kramatorsk, near the frontline, they heard Russian artillery fire daily. Fearing for their safety, they escaped to the distant Horokhiv community in Volyn Oblast. "We left everything behind a year and a half ago when the war started," Yulia said. "Now, we live in Horokhiv, in a kindergarten, with our two daughters, my husband, and his mother."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The transformation of the kindergarten into a makeshift shelter for displaced families was made possible through support from the <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/ukraine-governance-and-local-accountability-hoverla?ref=pubs.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>USAID HOVERLA</u></a> activity. "This assistance means everything to us, especially now, when we've had to leave everything we worked for," Yulia said. "Here, we feel safe and settled, almost like home, because we have everything we need."&nbsp;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/assets/images/2024/08/IMG_4123.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="/assets/images/size/w600/2024/08/IMG_4123.jpg 600w, /assets/images/size/w1000/2024/08/IMG_4123.jpg 1000w, /assets/images/size/w1600/2024/08/IMG_4123.jpg 1600w, /assets/images/2024/08/IMG_4123.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Yulia Stepanenko relocated from Kramatorsk to Horokhiv.

Thanks to an ERA grant, the <a href="http://www.women.lviv.ua/en/about-us/?ref=pubs.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>Women’s Perspective Center</u></a> (WPC) has been able to provide significant support to internally displaced women in Lviv. From February 2023 to March 2024, for example, WPC provided 670 hours of counseling to 300 displaced women, along with 240 hours of social support and study courses. &nbsp;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/assets/images/2024/08/Oksana-Buhera-2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="682" height="1024" srcset="/assets/images/size/w600/2024/08/Oksana-Buhera-2.jpg 600w, /assets/images/2024/08/Oksana-Buhera-2.jpg 682w"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Olha Shved, a musician displaced from Chernihiv, found renewed hope through WPC’s programs, gaining practical skills and connecting to a supportive community.

Following integration meetings organized by the Volyn Institute of Law, with support from USAID HOVERLA, Mayor Viktor Hodyk had the idea of bringing people together through music, an initiative that aims to unite the community, integrate people from unstable regions, and nurture local artistic talent. For example, a new jazz band comprises locals and a displaced person from Luhansk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/assets/images/2024/08/guitat.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="480" height="376"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Guitarist Dmytro Mukhtarov, displaced from Luhansk, plays in a newly formed band.

But they represent only a fraction of the larger population of displaced people in Ukraine, let alone worldwide. Ultimately, the best way to support Ukrainian refugees is by helping the Ukrainian government build back its internal capacity to protect and support its citizens. And beyond that, we need to tackle the root causes of displacement, from war and conflict to environmental crises, climate change impacts, and economic drivers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Several of DAI’s USAID-funded programs in Ukraine are focused on reinforcing the internal capacity of Ukrainian local governments and underpinning the resilience of Ukrainian industry and commerce. Keeping the economy moving and assisting Ukrainian authorities in hosting displaced people in their own country will in turn reduce the strain on neighboring nations, preventing mass outward migration that could overwhelm nearby countries' resources. Sustaining those efforts will require continued international cooperation and support.&nbsp;</p><div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-grey"><div class="kg-callout-text"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannahfairweather2001/?ref=pubs.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">Hannah Fairweather</a>, a DAI intern, is a student at the University of Maryland pursuing a master's degree in international relations.</div></div>
